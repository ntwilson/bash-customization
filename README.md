# docker-dev-customization

## Description

Contains a Dockerfile and associated build artefacts for starting with a generic dev image (called "mea" in this case) and applying personal customizations (installing & setting up neovim, oh-my-posh, etc.). (Also contains a customize.sh which is an out-of-date shell script version of doing what's in the Dockerfile.)
